# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Solutions are written in C++, and the first few I also did in Go.

Solutions written in C++ should compile with any recent C++20 compatible compiler.
Simple Makefiles are provided, I've only tested these on Linux.

Due to lack of time, most solutions are not as clean as they could/should be. Especially the more complex problems were done an hour at a time, spread over multiple evening sessions, and it shows. My main focus was on finishing the contest, not on crafting the most beautiful solutions.
